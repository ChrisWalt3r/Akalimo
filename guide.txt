2. SP Search: System searches for available service providers based on distance and service category and sends them notifications.
3. Response Handling:
    ◦ Backend Communication: Generate push notifications and messages for backend communication (e.g., notifying the customer of SP profile and arrival time).
    ◦ Assessment Fee Quotation: System calculates and quotes the assessment fee based on the customer's location plus an auto-populated base fare.
4. Quotation Processing:
    ◦ Quotation Generation: Generate a formal quotation document that is sent to the customer via email and app inbox.
    ◦ Payment Trigger: Upon the service receiver confirming the quotation and making the 50% payment.
    ◦ Material and Transport Automation:
        ▪ System sends a notification and message to the service provider to start work, listing the materials needed and the specific outlet where they must be purchased.
        ▪ System sends a text message to the designated outlet detailing the service provider's ID number, materials to be purchased, and total costs.
        ▪ System sends transport money directly to the service provider's wallet account.
5. Completion and Rating: System receives and relays progress updates and manages ratings for both the service provider and the customer.

Tech stack:
Frontend (Client-Side)

The frontend of TrustRent will be built using React.js for component-based UI development. Vite will serve as the build tool to ensure extremely fast bundling and development performance. For design and responsiveness, Tailwind CSS will be used.
State management will be handled using either Redux Toolkit or React Query for efficient global state and server data caching.

The map interface will be implemented using Leaflet.js integrated with OpenStreetMap tiles to display item locations and markers. Communication with the backend will be done using either Axios or the native Fetch API. User form interactions and validation will rely on React Hook Form combined with Zod or Yup validators. UI icons will be provided through HeroIcons or Lucide. For item image uploads, the client will use Cloudinary’s client-side SDK.

Backend (Server-Side)

The backend will be built using Node.js and Express.js, which will handle routing, REST API management, user authentication, and business logic. Database communication will be managed by Prisma ORM, providing migrations and type-safe queries.
User authentication will be handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and password hashing will be implemented using either bcrypt or argon2 for high security.

API documentation will be written with Swagger or Redoc. Images uploaded by users will be stored using Cloudinary’s API, and payment processing will be integrated via PesaPal Payment API.
For geocoding (location search and coordinates), the backend will optionally communicate with the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API.

Database Layer

The application’s primary database will be PostgreSQL, chosen for its reliability and strong relational integrity. A secondary cache store such as Redis may be included to improve performance for sessions, frequently accessed queries, and search results. Item images will not be stored directly in the database but will be stored in Cloudinary, with URLs referenced in the database.

And ensure that you use right project structure.
